    **Notes:**

    - All required environment variables must be set before running the application.
    - Never give environment variable values to non-administrator users,
      since they could hack your server instance.
    - You can generate secrets using tools
      such as [Random Key Gen](https://randomkeygen.com/)
      or [All Keys Generator](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx).
      256-bit keys are recommended.
    - For setting the `PUBLIC_HOST_ADDRESS` environment variable,
      you can use your domain name or your public IP address.
    - For security reasons, it is recommended to use a dedicated e-mail account to send e-mails.
    - For security reasons,
      `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SALT_KEY` and `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SECURITY_KEY`
      must be different from each other.

## Features

## Running

### Using Docker (Recommended)

In order to run the application using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
you must have Docker installed on your machine.

For running the application with Docker, you will need to mount both
the database and the SSL key store files using Docker volumes
and map port `8080` to your host machine.

#### Docker CLI

- **Windows**

    ```shell
    > docker run -dp 8080:8080 \
        -v <path\to\database>:${DATABASE_PATH} \
        -v <path\to\keystore>:${SSL_KEY_STORE} \
        --env-file <path\to\env\file> \
        --name <container-name> \
        juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>
    ```

- **MacOS/Linux**

    ```shell
    $ docker run -dp 8080:8080 \
        -v <path/to/database>:${DATABASE_PATH} \
        -v <path/to/keystore>:${SSL_KEY_STORE} \
        --env-file <path/to/env/file> \
        --name <container-name> \
        juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>
    ```

#### Docker Compose

For running the application with Docker Compose,
you can use the
[Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Juansecu/OpenFusion-OpenAPI-Plugin/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
provided in this repository for development and production,
but for production, you will also need to
remove the `build` property from the `openapi` service,
change the `image` property to `juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>`
and configure the following environment variables:

- `LOCAL_DATABASE_PATH` - The path in the host machine to the OpenFusion database to connect
- `LOCAL_SSL_KEY_STORE` - The path in the host machine to the keystore file

After configuring the environment variables, you can run the application using the following command:

- **Docker Compose v1**

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

- **Docker Compose v2**

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```

### Using Java

For running the application with Java,
you will need to set the necessary environment variables
and follow the instructions below.

#### For Development

In order to run the application for development,
you will need to clone this repository,
compile the application and run it using the following commands:

- **Windows**

    ```shell
    # --- BUILDING ---

    # For building the application without running tests
    > .\mvnw package -DskipTests

    # For building the application and running tests (not working yet)
    > .\mvnw package


    # --- RUNNING ---

    # For running the application
    > java -jar .\target\openfusion-openapi-plugin-<version number>.jar
    ```
  
- **MacOS/Linux**

    ```shell
    # --- BUILDING ---

    # For building the application without running tests
    $ ./mvnw package -DskipTests

    # For building the application and running tests (not working yet)
    $ ./mvnw package


    # --- RUNNING ---

    # For running the application
    $ java -jar ./target/openfusion-openapi-plugin-<version number>.jar
    ```

#### For Production

In order to run the application for production,
you will only need to download the latest release
from the [releases page](https://github.com/Juansecu/OpenFusion-OpenAPI-Plugin/releases),
set the necessary environment variables
and run the application using the following command:

- **Windows**

    ```shell
    > java -jar .\openfusion-openapi-plugin-<version number>.jar
    ```

- **MacOS/Linux**

    ```shell
    $ java -jar ./openfusion-openapi-plugin-<version number>.jar
    ```
