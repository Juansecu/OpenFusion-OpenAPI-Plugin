based on [OpenFusion](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusion).

## Requirements

- **Java -** Version 17

- **Database -** An existent SQLite database of OpenFusion

- **SSL _(Secure Sockets Layer)_ Key Store -** A keystore file that contains a private key and a certificate

- SMTP _(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)_ Server that supports MIME messages and TLS connections

- **Environment variables**

    **Notes:**

    - All required environment variables must be set before running the application.
    - Never give environment variable values to non-administrator users,
      since they could hack your server instance.
    - You can generate secrets using tools
      such as [Random Key Gen](https://randomkeygen.com/)
      or [All Keys Generator](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx).
      256-bit keys are recommended.
    - For security reasons, it is recommended to use a dedicated e-mail account to send e-mails.
    - For security reasons,
      `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SALT_KEY` and `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SECURITY_KEY`
      must be different from each other.

## Features

You can check the current state of features [here](https://github.com/Juansecu/OpenFusion-OpenAPI-Plugin/wiki/Features).

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at the endpoint `/docs`.

## User Interface

The user interface is available at the endpoint `/auth/login`.

## Running

### Using Docker (Recommended)

In order to run the application using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
you must have Docker installed on your machine.

For running the application with Docker, you will need to mount both
the database and the SSL key store files using Docker volumes
and map port `8080` to your host machine.

#### Docker CLI

- **Windows**

    ```shell
    > docker run -dp 8080:8080 \
        -v <path\to\database>:${DATABASE_PATH} \
        -v <path\to\keystore>:${SSL_KEY_STORE} \
        --env-file <path\to\env\file> \
        --name <container-name> \
        juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>
    ```

- **MacOS/Linux**

    ```shell
    $ docker run -dp 8080:8080 \
        -v <path/to/database>:${DATABASE_PATH} \
        -v <path/to/keystore>:${SSL_KEY_STORE} \
        --env-file <path/to/env/file> \
        --name <container-name> \
        juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>
    ```

#### Docker Compose

For running the application with Docker Compose,
you can use the
[Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Juansecu/OpenFusion-OpenAPI-Plugin/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
provided in this repository for development and production,
but for production, you will also need to
remove the `build` property from the `openapi` service,
change the `image` property to `juansecu/openfusion-openapi-plugin:v<version number>`
and configure the following environment variables:

- `LOCAL_DATABASE_PATH` - The path in the host machine to the OpenFusion database to connect
- `LOCAL_SSL_KEY_STORE` - The path in the host machine to the keystore file

After configuring the environment variables, you can run the application using the following command:

- **Docker Compose v1**

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

- **Docker Compose v2**

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```
