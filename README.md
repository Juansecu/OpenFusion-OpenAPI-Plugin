    **Notes:**

    - All required environment variables must be set before running the application.
    - Never give environment variable values to non-administrator users, since they could hack your server instance.
    - You can generate secrets using tools
      such as [Random Key Gen](https://randomkeygen.com/)
      or [All Keys Generator](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx).
      256-bit keys are recommended.
    - For security reasons, it is recommended to use a dedicated e-mail account to send e-mails.
    - For security reasons, `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SALT_KEY` and `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_SECURITY_KEY` must be different from each other.
